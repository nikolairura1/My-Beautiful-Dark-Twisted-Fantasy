 spain.9.t:0 "Spanish Election of 1936"
 spain.9.d:0 "The Second Republic has proven to be a fragile existence. Manuel Azaña can be president with the backing of the Popular Front, a broad coalition of left-wing groups supported by republicans, communists and anarchists.\n\nBut the right-wing opposition, encompassing conservatives, monarchists and fascists, is also beginning to unite for the cause of bringing down the Popular Front. Whichever coalition falls apart, their opponents are likely to take advantage of their internal conflicts to launch a revolution. This election is not the final test Spain will have to endure to resolve this conflict."
 spain.9.a:0 "Maintain the Popular Front."
 spain.9.b:0 "Unite the conservative groups under Falange."
