rename the folder to mbdtf

the rules are as follows:
1)    You may not change the starting positions of any nations
2)    You may only commit to the master branch during your turn
3)    You can work on your own branch whenever you want
4)    You cannot interfere with anyone else’s branch
5)    You are encouraged to not work on this mod until it’s your turn. This is a modjam, not your second project
6)    Each turn lasts for 48 hours
7)    You must list the changes you have made in the changelog. The more detailed the better.
